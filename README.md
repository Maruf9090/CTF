# CTF
CTF Tools

This repository is a place where I want to keep all the useful resources/websites/tools to solve CTF challenges. All the tools will be divided by category, in order to have a better organization.

This repo is for me but also for my CTF team, and why not for whoever will get to this page.

It will contain even some "obvious" links, like the ASCII table and so on, because it is a page indended to be kept open during CTFs: you never know what will come in handy!
